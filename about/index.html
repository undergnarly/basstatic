    <!-- WHAT IS BASSTATIC -->
    <section class="section page__section">
      <h1 class="section__title">What is Basstatic</h1>
      <p class="section__text">Basstatic is a cultural movement centered around bass, movement, and inner state.</p>
      <p class="section__text">It is a space where music becomes a tool for release, expression, and transformation. A place where people come not just to dance, but to reconnect with themselves through vibration, rhythm, and presence.</p>
      <p class="section__text">At the core of Basstatic is the idea that sound — especially low frequencies — affects the body, the mind, and the emotional field. Through deep bass and conscious movement, the dance becomes a form of meditation, a reset, and a way to return to an authentic state.</p>
      <p class="section__text">It is not a party in the usual sense.<br>It is a shared experience.<br>A field where individuality and unity exist at the same time.</p>

    <!-- HISTORY -->
    <section class="section page__section">
      <h2 class="section__title">History</h2>
      <p class="section__text">Basstatic began in Goa in January 2020 as an exploration of bass music as a conscious dance practice.</p>
      <p class="section__text">From there, the movement continued to grow on Koh Phangan, where it found a natural home within an open and experimental community. Over time, gatherings became regular, and the dance evolved into a recognizable format and atmosphere that people returned to again and again.</p>
      <p class="section__text">Today, Basstatic continues to live through weekly events on Koh Phangan, carried forward by the local community, while a new chapter is being activated in Bali with regular sessions planned twice a month.</p>
      <p class="section__text">Rather than being tied to one place, Basstatic moves with the people who carry its spirit — adapting, evolving, and reappearing in new locations.</p>

    <!-- THE IDEA -->
    <section class="section page__section">
      <h2 class="section__title">The Idea</h2>
      <p class="section__text">Basstatic is about entering a state.</p>
      <p class="section__text">A state where the mind becomes quieter, the body takes over, and emotions find their natural expression through movement.</p>
      <p class="section__text">The practice is rooted in the understanding that dance has always been part of human culture — from ancient ritual movement to modern bass-driven gatherings. It is both personal and collective, tribal and individual at the same time.</p>
      <p class="section__text">There is no performance, no judgment, no expectations.<br>Only sound, movement, and presence.</p>

    <!-- SOUND -->
    <section class="section page__section">
      <h2 class="section__title">Sound</h2>
      <p class="section__text">The musical foundation of Basstatic is built around bass-driven genres, including:</p>
      <ul class="section__list">
        <li>Dub</li>
        <li>UK Garage</li>
        <li>Dubstep</li>
        <li>Jungle</li>
        <li>Drum &amp; Bass</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="section__text">All styles are connected by one element — deep, physical low frequencies that can be felt in the body and guide the movement naturally.</p>
