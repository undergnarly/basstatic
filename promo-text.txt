Yo,

We're rebooting Basstatic in Bali and we're stoked to have you here.

The idea is simple — we want to bring proper UK dance music to the island. Garage, dubstep, jungle, drum & bass — the stuff that moves your chest before it moves your feet. We respect the roots and we're not here to water anything down.

But it's more than just music. We want to build a real community around bass culture, soundsystem vibes, and people who actually care about this sound. No pretense, no VIP tables — just good people, heavy subs, and honest selectors.

Basstatic has been running since 2020 — from Goa to Thailand and now Bali. 30+ gatherings later, we're starting a fresh chapter.

Come through.

BASSTATIC: Chapter One
Saturday, 21 February · Doors from 6 PM
ASH, Nuanu Creative City · Bali

Roba Grow · Muvs · Vokvi

UK Garage · Dubstep · Jungle · Drum & Bass

Early Birds: Rp 100K (limited)

Tickets: megatix.co.id/events/basstatic-chapter-one

In soundsystem music we trust.

Hey everyone,

We're relaunching Basstatic in Bali and we'd love for you to be part of it.

Our thing is modern UK dance music — garage, dubstep, jungle, d&b — delivered the way it should be, through a proper soundsystem. We value the roots, and we're here to grow a healthy community of bass lovers on the island. No ego, just frequencies.

This has been brewing since 2020 across Goa and Thailand. Now it's Bali's turn.

Join us for the first one:

BASSTATIC: Chapter One
21 Feb · 6 PM · ASH, Nuanu · Bali
Roba Grow · Muvs · Vokvi · MC Nyoman · Slingkyboyslim
